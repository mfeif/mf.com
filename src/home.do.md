I code, consult, coach, cook and tinker. I make physical, virtual, and social things. I volunteer, share, teach and build community. I have many wide interests and some deep expertise. I love collaborating with passionate people on the best possible projects.

I’m a member of a “<a href="http://sector67.org" title="Sector67 in Madison, WI" target="_blank">MakerSpace</a>” and a social-enterprise focussed [Co-Working Space]. I love to cook-in and eat-out, ride bikes, build bikes, and take photographs. I design and build hackety furniture, and tinker with DIY hifi. I ferment foods, work part-time in Madison’s best <a href="http://www.squarewineco.com" title="Square Wine Company" target="_blank">wine-shop</a>, and bowl a shaky 160.

I was a chapter leader in the [Slow Food] movement for 12 years, in both [New York City] and [Madison].
