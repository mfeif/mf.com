I’m an independent software developer and technology consultant by trade, specializing in data-driven web applications for small business. I made my first web-site in 1995, and have been semi-at-it ever since.

**Lately**, I’ve mostly consulted for a startup in a niche of the steel industry, doing a variety of research-oriented B2B software projects and service prototypes, but also a wide variety of small-business generalism, from product development to technical illustration.

I haven’t had a “real job” in a long time and I like it that way — lifestyle is under-rated in our culture. I’ve owned my own business(es) or been an independent contractor since I was 23. I am available to collaborate: I love working with excited, exceptional people on fascinating projects.
