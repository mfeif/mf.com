**[FoodWorks Madison] is a community-service organization founded on a strong belief in the central role of food to
improve our lives.**

"First Course" is a three-week job-training program for professional kitchens, designed to provide un- and
under-employed adults with the kitchen skills, confidence, and connections they need to get good jobs in
food service. We cover cooking, knife skills, professional kitchen practices and traditions, food safety,
equipment and ingredients, and soft skills like job seeking and interviewing. We are committed to guiding
all graduates to curated job leads that set them up to pursue their goals and long-term success.
FoodWorks builds and maintains networks in pursuit of this mission and collaborates with other
like-minded institutions, economies, ecologies, and entrepreneurs in and around Madison.
