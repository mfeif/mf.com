# Tech Work Experience

2008-2017
:   Independent consultant. My main client was a startup in the steel industry; where I made web-based calculation tools and software prototypes, made technical drawings, managed projects, and supervised marketing materials including print catalogs and direct email campaigns.
:   I had one successful web app that was in live production from 2006 through 2018, and several other shorter-lived apps.

2013
:   Launched "[Twinkler]" a web-based toy that makes art from images. I wrote the engine, designed and built the site, made all the graphic elements and images, and wrote and illustrated the [explanation sections][twinkler_explain] (which I really like).

1997-2008
:   Founder, *Digital Alchemy*, a web-development company specializing in data-driven websites for small businesses. Clients included Eileen Fisher, Compaq, Castrol, Rainforest Alliance and many small organizations including a financial news startup, a hi-fi speaker manufacturer, a jazz archive, and high-school debate organizations.

:   In the early days, the web was “DIY”. We made our own versioned content management systems, asset management systems, authorization/authentication systems, form generation libraries, and so on, and administered our own servers. We used these frameworks, tools and systems in our client work and our own projects.

:   Key independent projects included *"FolioSpace"*, a portfolio service for artists to showcase their work online, *[CocktailDB.com]*, a sophisticated cocktail recipe database using most of the frameworks mentioned above (still online, though not updated in 10 years).

1996-1997
:   Founder and director of production at *Coherent Light*, a startup in New York City with a focus on audio/visual post-production work, video-graphics, and 3D animation.

:   Coherent Light worked on a wide variety of projects including the production of the first [demo reel][maxvideo] for [Autodesk's 3D-Studio MAX][max], various short videos, films, commercials, and a web-based soap opera.

:   After pivoting from videographics/audio-post to the web, we secured one round of venture capital to design and build a retail search engine. We were ultimately unable to raise a second round of financing, and closed up shop gracefully.

1995-1996
:   Web developer, graphic artist at *D3 Design* in Kansas City, MO. Coded Kansas City Public Television's first website.

1995
:   As a freelance web developer, I made the first corporate site for Porter Novelli, then the world's fourth largest public relations firm.
