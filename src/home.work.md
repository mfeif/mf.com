Iâ€™m an independent software developer and technology consultant by trade, specializing in data-driven web applications for small business. I made my first web-site in 1995, and have been semi-at-it ever since.

I'm a founder and the executive director of [FoodWorks Madison], a start-up not-for-profit built to increase social equity in Madison by creating a short-term hands-on training program for kitchen jobs.

I am a managing partner at [Working Draft Beer Company], a craft brewery and taproom in Madison, that has just had its first birthday.
