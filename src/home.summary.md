I'm a passionate and curious geek, maker, cook and <nobr>*do-it-yourself*-ist</nobr>. I live in my hometown of [Madison, Wisconsin] in a [110-year-old building] with my two cats.

I've lived in Manhattan for 14 years and in a solar-powered straw-bale house in a cow pasture for one. I've travelled in Mexico, India, Finland, and Europe.
