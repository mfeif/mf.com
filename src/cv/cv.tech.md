# Tech Work Experience

2020-Current
:   Consulting Chief Technology Officer for [Blue Trunk Foundation], a nonprofit dedicated to collecting and sharing information for travelers that have special health or accessibility needs. I'm advising the organization and rebuilding their core product, moving some systems to SaaS platforms and redesigning/reimplementing the custom core for sustainability, full documentation, pragmatic/conservative tech choices, and feature completeness

2008-Current
:   Independent consultant. My main client has been a manufacturer in the steel industry; I make web-based calculation tools and software prototypes, technical drawings, have managed projects, and supervised marketing materials including print catalogs and direct email campaigns.
:   I had one successful web app that was in live production from 2006 through 2018, and several other shorter-lived apps.

2013
:   Launched "[Twinkler]" a web-based toy that makes art from images. I wrote the engine, designed and built the site, made all the graphic elements and images, and wrote and illustrated the [explanation sections][twinkler_explain] (which I really like).

1997-2008
:   Founder, *Digital Alchemy*, a web-development company specializing in data-driven websites for small businesses. Clients included Eileen Fisher, Compaq, Castrol, Rainforest Alliance and many small organizations including a financial news startup, a hi-fi speaker manufacturer, a jazz archive, and high-school debate organizations.

:   In the early days, the web was “DIY”. We made our own versioned content management systems, asset management systems, authorization/authentication systems, form generation libraries, and so on, and administered our own servers. We used these frameworks, tools and systems in our client work and our own projects.

:   Key independent projects included *"FolioSpace"*, a portfolio service for artists to showcase their work online, *[CocktailDB.com]*, a sophisticated cocktail recipe database using most of the frameworks mentioned above (still online, though not updated in 10 years).

1996-1997
:   Founder and director of production at *Coherent Light*, a startup in New York City with a focus on audio/visual post-production work, video-graphics, and 3D animation.

:   Coherent Light worked on a wide variety of projects including the production of the first [demo reel][maxvideo] for [Autodesk's 3D-Studio MAX][max], various short videos, films, commercials, and a web-based soap opera.

:   After pivoting from videographics/audio-post to the web, we secured one round of venture capital to design and build a retail search engine. We were ultimately unable to raise a second round of financing, and closed up shop gracefully.

1995-1996
:   Web developer, graphic artist at *D3 Design* in Kansas City, MO. Coded Kansas City Public Television's first website.

1995
:   As a freelance web developer, I made the first corporate site for Porter Novelli, then the world's fourth largest public relations firm.
