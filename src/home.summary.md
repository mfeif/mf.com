I'm a passionate, curious geek & *do-it-yourself*-ist. I live in my hometown of Madison, Wisconsin in a 100-year-old building with my two cats.

I've lived in Manhattan and in a solar-powered straw-bale house in a cow pasture. I've travelled in Mexico, India, Finland, and lots of Europe. 

I have many wide interests and some deep expertise. I love collaborating with passionate people on the best possible projects.
